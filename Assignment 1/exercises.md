# Assignment 1

## 1 Understanding MDPs

### 1.1 Chess

### 1.2 LunarLander

### 1.3 Model Based RL: Accessing Environment Dynamics

## 2 Implementing a GridWorld
All the code can be found in the file GridWorld.py

### 2.1 Look up some examples
Examples found on the internet:
1. https://github.com/michaeltinsley/Gridworld-with-Q-Learning-Reinforcement-Learning-
2. https://github.com/adityajain07/ReinforcementLearning-Gridworld
3. https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lib/envs/gridworld.py

## 2.2 Implementing the MDP
The MDP is deterministic because the same action always has the same outcome given the state we are currently in. For example if the agent decides to perform the action right, it will always move right and arrive at the state next to it on the right side.
